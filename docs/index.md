Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Pretty Math is striving to bring editing, rendering and even calculating math on a computer into the 21st century.

As modern software engineers, we've grown accustom to our fancy code editors with intellisense and autocomplete. We lean on autocomplete when we type search terms into Google and expect `@mentions` in Slack to correctly predict our intentions with just a few characters.

But these tools were all built for text-based input only. Math is inherently more complicated than that. And when we attempt to "dumb" math down into plain text it gets *really* messy, really quickly. Ever tried to read or edit a formula with more than a couple operators in Excel? Or tried to edit a LaTeX equation? Then you know the pain.

Pretty Math is bringing the niceties that we have all grown to expect in text-based editing to math editing. We're building an incredibly powerful and flexible math input field written in React.

We're super excited about what we are doing and hope you are too. We have very lofty goals for Pretty Math but know we can't do it ourselves. We are always looking for other talented engineers to join the team. If you are interested, please reach out!

Otherwise, if you're here to bring a great math experience to your users, then continue on to our Quick Start Guide.
