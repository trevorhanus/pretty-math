A `PrettyMathInput` component is an input field that allows the user to input math.

## Props

The props allow the `PrettyMathInput` to be very flexible. You can use the props to customize the behavior of the component. Below is a summary of the props available followed by a more in depth discussion for each.

```
interface PrettyMathInputProps {
    inputState: InputState;
    onChange: (inputState: InputState) => void;
    keyBindingFn: (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => string;
    handleCommand: (command: string, inputState: InputState) => CommandHandlerResponse;
    renderBlock: (block: Block) => React.ReactNode;
    onBlur: (e: React.BlurEvent) => void;
    onFocus: (e: React.FocusEvent) => void;
}
```

### `inputState`

```
inputState: InputState;
```

This `InputState` object to be rendered by the `PrettyMathInput`.

### `onChange`

```
onChange: (inputState: InputState) => void;
```

The `onChange` handler to be called by the `PrettyMathInput` when edits and selection changes occur.

### `keyBindingFn`

```
keyBindingFn: (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => string;
```

A callback function to be called on every `keydown` event. You can use this callback to add custom functionality to the `PrettyMathInput`. This callback should return a string which is the name of a command to invoke. Alternatively, it can return nothing, which tells Pretty Math to perform whatever the default command is for this key.

### `handleCommand`

```
handleCommand: (command: string, inputState: InputState) => CommandHandlerResponse;
```

A callback that is called before Pretty Math handles a command.  

### `renderBlock`

```
renderBlock: (block: Block) => React.ReactNode;
```

A callback to override how a block renders.

### `className`

```
className: string;
```

Additional classes to append to the root `div`.

### `readOnly`

```
readOnly: boolean;
```

Just like the readonly prop on the basic html `input` element. Setting to `true` disables the input field.

### `focusOnMount`

```
focusOnMount: boolean;
```

Focus the input field when the React lifecycle method `componentDidMount` is invoked.

### `onBlur`

```
onBlur: () => void;
```

### `onFocus`

```
onFocus: () => void;
```

### `onCancel`

```
onCancel: () => void;
```

This is a convenience callback which is invoked when the user presses the `esc` key.

> By default, should this return the state of the input back to what it was when it was last focused? Also, should this be called before or after the `onBlur` callback?

### `onCursorLeave`

```
onCursorLeave: (dir: Dir) => void;
```

A callback that is invoked when the cursor is at an edge boundary of the input and an arrow key in the direction of the boundary is pressed. The `Dir` is one of `left`, `right`, `up`, or `down`.

### `onDeleteOutOf`

```
onDeleteOutOf: (dir: Dir) => void;
```

Very similar to the `onCursorLeave` callback expect in this case the user pressed the `backspace` or `delete` key.

### `onSubmit`

```
onSubmit: () => void;
```

### `getAssistantItems`

```
getAssistantItems: (inputState: InputState) => LibraryItem[];
```

Callback which is invoked after every state change and before the Assistant is rendered. The result of this callback determines what is shown in the autocomplete list of the Assistant.

### `renderAssistant`

```
renderAssistant: (props: AssistantProps) => React.ReactNode;
```

Callback which allows us to override how the Assistant renders. See the Assistant page for more information about the `AssistantProps`.

### `renderAssistantItem`

```
renderAssistantItem: (itemProps: AssistantItemProps) => React.ReactNode;
```

Callback which allows us to override how the Assistant renders it's items and to render custom items that were previously returned from the `getAssistantItems` callback. See [Adding Custom Assistant Items]() for more info.
